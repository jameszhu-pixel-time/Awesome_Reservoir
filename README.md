## Reservoir Plan
- Initial Phase:
    - Improve survey contents:
        - How Optimization works in this problem, enviornment swiches, successful modeling.
        *** Important: we need to figure out how physics constraints translate to optimization problem, then to reinforcement learning scenario.
        - How other solve this kind of problems?
    - Actions
- Second Phase:
    - Algorithm Implementation
    - Dataset Generation
    - Framework Engineering
- Third Phase:
    - Framework applied
    - Model Training
    - Model Evaluation
